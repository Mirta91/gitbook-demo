## Docs Like Code

The** **[**Docs Like Code** methodology](https://www.docslikecode.com/about/) is a subset of **Agile**, and it means using the same tools and processes for the docs as you would for the software.

{% hint style="info" %}
Consider code documentation that lives alongside the software, possibly in GitHub or similar tool – otherwise, none of your developers will read it.
{% endhint %}

Most developers don’t dislike writing documentation. What they dislike is the workflow.&#x20;

* A developer has to switch tools when they want to document something (outside of in-code documentation). &#x20;
* This context-switch makes them reluctant to write docs, so the task gets pushed off to the very end.

**User Documentation **

1. How-to guides – Problem-oriented, take the user through a series of steps to reach a real-world goal&#x20;
2. Tutorials – Learning-oriented, take the user through a series of steps to learn a concept&#x20;
3. Reference docs – Information-oriented, technical descriptions of the software (could include software design documents)&#x20;
4. Explanations – Understanding-oriented, they clarify or illuminate a particular topic for a user

**For Developers Only**

1. [API documentation](readme/api-demo.md) – Reference documentation regarding making API calls and classes&#x20;
2. [Release notes](readme/releasenotes-demo.md) – Information describing the latest software or feature releases, and bug fixes&#x20;
3. [README ](readme/readme-demo.md)– A high-level overview of the software, usually alongside the source code&#x20;
4. System documentation – Documents describing the software system, including technical design documents, software requirements, and UML diagrams
